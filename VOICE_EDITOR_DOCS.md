## üöÄ **Implementation Architecture**

### **Modular IIFE Structure: `VoiceEditor`**

The voice editor is implemented as a self-contained IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) with a clean public API:

```javascript
const VoiceEditor = (function() {
    'use strict';
    
    // Private variables and functions
    let recognition = null;
    let isListening = false;
    let commandHistory = [];
    
    // Public API
    return {
        init: init,
        startListening: startListening,
        stopListening: stopListening,
        isActive: function() { return isListening; },
        getHistory: function() { return [...commandHistory]; },
        clearHistory: clearHistory,
        handleCommand: handleVoiceCommand // For testing
    };
})();
```

#### **Core Methods**

```javascript
// Initialization and Setup
init()                   // Initialize voice editor with UI and speech recognition
setupUI()               // Create and inject voice editor UI
setupSpeechRecognition() // Configure Web Speech API
setupEventListeners()    // Bind event handlers

// Main Control Methods
startListening()         // Begin voice recognition with visual feedback
stopListening()          // End voice recognition and cleanup
handleVoiceCommand()     // Process and execute recognized commands

// Enhanced Command Processors
updateName()            // Updates full name with flexible patterns
updatePhone()           // Updates phone number
updateEmail()           // Updates email address
updateAddress()         // Updates address/location
updateObjective()       // Updates career objective/summary
addSkill()             // Adds skills with proper badge creation
addSection()           // Handles section addition requests
removeLastProject()    // Removes last project from dynamic containers
showHelpDialog()       // Displays comprehensive help modal

// UI Management
updateUI()             // Updates button states and indicators
displayCommand()       // Shows recognized command text in real-time
updateStatus()         // Updates status messages and indicators
